# Calc
calculator

My first - made only by myself (without any tutorial or help) App - calculator in html, css and javascript.
In this project I used:
in html: BEM (Block-element-modifier)
in css: flexbox, keyframes some text shadow - thanks to this, this calc lookalike Cyberpunky in some way, googleFonts
in Javascript i used OOP (Class Calculator)

Calculator functions are: add, multiply, divide, power, substract numbers.
